\title{Calculate Monthly Solar Heat Gains}
\usage{
Q_Gains_Solar(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A list returned by the \code{\link{get_parameters}} function.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 12, representing the total solar heat gains for each month, 
  calculated for the entire building and normalized per square meter. Each element of the vector 
  corresponds to one month, reflecting the impact of solar irradiation variability throughout the year.
}
\description{
The function applies formula 104 to 109 of the SIA 380/1 norm, and aligns with varaible `Q_sX` and `Q_s`. \cr
`Q_Gains_Solar` estimates the solar heat gains through windows for each month, expressed in 
megajoules per square meter (MJ/mÂ²). It calculates the solar gains by considering the 
orientation, area, and specific properties of each window element, along with the monthly solar 
irradiation. The calculation accounts for factors such as the window's opacity, frame factor, and 
shading factor, normalizing the gains to the building's area.
