\title{Calculate Building's Heat Transfer Coefficient}
\usage{
Heat_Transfer_Coefficient(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A list returned by the \code{\link{get_parameters}} function.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The overall heat transfer coefficient of the building, expressed in Watts per degree 
  Celsius (W/Â°C). This value provides a comprehensive measure of the building's thermal 
  transmittance, incorporating both conduction through the envelope and convection via ventilation.
}
\description{
The function applies formula 100 of the SIA 380/1 norm, and aligns with varaible `H`.\cr
`Heat_Transfer_Coefficient` computes the overall heat transfer coefficient of a building. 
This coefficient is a measure of the building's ability to 
transfer heat through its envelope, including both opaque elements (walls, roof, floor) 
and the effect of ventilation. The calculation takes into account the U-values of the 
building elements, their areas, and any adjustment factors, as well as the impact of 
ventilation based on the building's volume and the specific heat capacity of air at the 
building's altitude.
