\title{Calculate Total Monthly Heat Demand}
\usage{
Q_Total(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A list returned by the \code{\link{get_parameters}} function.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 12, representing the total heat demand for each month, measured in
megajoules per square meter (MJ/mÂ²). The result reflects the sum of space heating demand and DHW
demand for each month, accounting for seasonal variations in energy requirements.
}
\description{
\code{Q_Total} computes the total monthly heat demand for a building, combining both the heating demand
for space heating and the domestic hot water (DHW) demand.
