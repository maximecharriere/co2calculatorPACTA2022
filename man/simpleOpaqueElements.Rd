\title{Generate Simple Opaque Building Elements}
\usage{
simpleOpaqueElements(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A list containing parameters for the building, including:
\describe{
\item{uValuesBefore}{A list of U-values for various building elements.}
\item{area}{Total floor area of the building.}
\item{floors}{Number of floors in the building.}
}}
}
\value{
A list of lists, where each sublist represents an opaque building element (roof, floor, or walls).
Each element includes:
\describe{
\item{name}{The name of the building element.}
\item{uValue}{The thermal transmittance (U-value) of the element.}
\item{area}{The area of the element in square meters.}
\item{factor}{A factor used in calculations, set to 1 for all elements in this simplified model.}
}
}
\description{
\code{simpleOpaqueElements} generates a list of simple opaque building elements based on the provided
parameters. This includes the roof, floor, and walls of the building, with each element's thermal
properties (U-values) and areas calculated according to the input parameters and predefined constants
within the function. This function is useful for estimating the thermal characteristics of a building's
envelope in a simplified manner.
}
\details{
The function simplifies the calculation by assuming standard building geometries and
applying fixed ratios for window areas and roof angles. It is intended for preliminary
assessments and may not substitute detailed thermal modeling.
