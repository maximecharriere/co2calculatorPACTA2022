\title{Calculate Monthly Body Heat Gains}
\usage{
Q_Gains_BodyHeat(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A list returned by the \code{\link{get_parameters}} function.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 12, representing the heat gains from occupants for each month,
calculated based on the heat emission rate per person, the density of occupants, and the total
occupied area. The gains are normalized to the building's area and adjusted for the number of days
in each month, providing a monthly breakdown of body heat contributions to the building's internal gains.
}
\description{
The function applies formula 102 of the SIA 380/1 norm, and aligns with varaible \code{Q_iP}.\cr
\code{Q_Gains_BodyHeat} estimates the monthly heat gains attributed to occupants within a building,
expressed in megajoules per square meter (MJ/mÂ²). This function calculates the heat generated
by the human body, considering the time spent by a person in the building, their heat emission rate, and
the occupied area.
